# Caching Patterns

## Introduction
Caching patterns are well known techniques to access and keep data up to date in your caching layer.

One of the biggest challenges, it's to have data in the cache with the same state of the data in to the persistent datastore, that is the database.

Most of the time, the synchronization between the cache and database is done at application level by implementing a dual write.
Unfortunately this technique is just another problem to solve, in fact if one of the two writes fails, you might end up with inconsistent data.

Here is an example of a high level architecture for a dual write:

![Mutable operations without caching pattern](images/No-Patterns-1.png)

In case of reading data, the application needs to check if the data is available in cache, and if not, the application has to fetch ("1") the data from the database, put ("2") into the cache and then send it back to the requester.
This technique is known with name of Cache-Aside or Lazy-Loading pattern, that will be also describe in the [next](#cache-aside-lazy-loading-read) section.

Here is an example of a high level architecture for such pattern:

![Immutable operations without caching pattern](images/No-Patterns-2.png)

In the next section I'll explain the most common patterns and how to implement them efficiently using Java 11, Redis and MySQL (it can be any database).

For sake of simplicity, the architecture will be based on Linux containers, using the Docker format image and Docker Compose to run them all together.

## Most common Caching Patterns
Here is the list of the most common used caching patterns:
- Cache-Aside (Lazy-loading)
- Read-Through
- Write-Through
- Write-Behind (Write-back)
- Refresh Ahead
- Read Replica

### Cache-Aside (Lazy-loading) read
This pattern describes how the data should be retrieved.
The application layer, the service, first checks if the data is available into the Redis cache.

If the data is available, it gets returned immediately to the requester.

If the data is __not__ available, the service looks for it into the database.
Once the data is retrieved from the database, it gets also set into the cache for later use, and finally returned to the requester.

![Cache-Aside read](images/Cache-Aside-AL.png)

More detail in the [Caching at application layer](#caching-at-application-layer) section.

### Read-Through
This pattern describes how the data should be retrieved.
The application layer, the service, only connects to the Redis cache, without ever connecting to the database.

Thus, the service requests the data from the Redis cache.
The caching layer, Redis, first checks if it has the data.

If the data is available, it gets returned immediately to the service.

If the data is __not__ available, Redis looks for it into the database.
Once the data is retrieved from the database, it gets set into the cache for later use, and finally returned to the service, and then to the requester.

More detail in the demo [section](#pattern-read-through).

![Read-Through](images/Read-Through-CL.png)

### Write-Through
This pattern describes how the data should be stored.

The application layer, the service, only connects to the Redis cache, without ever connecting to the database.

Thus, the service sends the data to be written into the Redis cache.
The caching layer, Redis, stores the data, and then sends the data to be written into the database as well.

Then entire chain is synchronous.

![Write-Through](images/Write-Through-AL.png)

Moving the logic from the application layer to the cache layer.

This can be done by using standard library API, or by using proprietary caching API provided by the vendor, so whatever works best for your use case.

More detail in the demo [section](#pattern-write-through).

![Write-Through](images/Write-Through-CL.png)

### Write-Behind (Write-back)
This pattern describes how the data should be stored.

The application layer, the service, only connects to the Redis cache, without ever connecting to the database.

Thus, the service sends the data to be written into the Redis cache.
The caching layer, Redis, stores the data, and then sends the data to be written into the database as well.

The last step of the chain is asynchronous, that is Redis calling the persistence layer.

![Write-Behind (Write-back)](images/Write-Behind-AL.png)

Moving the logic from the application layer to the cache layer.

This can be done by using standard library API, or by using proprietary caching API provided by the vendor, so whatever works best for your use case.

![Write-Behind (Write-back)](images/Write-Behind-CL.png)

More detail in the demo [section](#pattern-write-behind).

### Refresh Ahead
This pattern describes how the data can be updated automatically whenever it's expired.

![Refresh-Ahead](images/Refresh-Ahead-CL.png)

More detail in the demo [section](#pattern-refresh-ahead).

### Read Replica
This pattern describes how the data can be updated automatically from the database to the caching layer.

![Read-Replica](images/Read-Replica-CL.png)

More detail in the demo [section](#pattern-read-replica).

# The Cache layer
The caching layer is basically composed by two main components:
- Redis
- RedisGears

## Redis
Redis is the well known in-memory multi-model database, that is used as distributed cache, primary database, pubsub, streams, and so on.

![Redis](images/redis-logo-full-color-rgb.png)

## RedisGears
Redis provides a way to add custom logic (your code) into its engine, by using RedisGears, which is a serverless engine.

![RedisGears](images/redisGears-white.png)

As a Serverless engine, RedisGears supports three programming languages:
- C
- Python
- JVM (Java, Scala)

JavaScript is coming soon...

However, if you still want the whole control to be at application layer, Spring and its caching capabilities, that is what you are looking for.

## Caching at application layer
Using Spring is the key point to easy the entire process, without adding any custom logic to Redis.

![Spring Data](images/spring-data.png)

The integration between the application and Redis is delegated to Spring using its
```@EnableCaching``` annotation,
and by specifying Redis as its cache layer into the ```application.properties```, as follows:

```properties
spring.cache.type=redis
spring.redis.client-type=jedis
spring.redis.cluster.max-redirects= # Maximum number of redirects to follow when executing commands across the cluster.
spring.redis.cluster.nodes= # Comma-separated list of "host:port" pairs to bootstrap from.
spring.redis.database=0 # Database index used by the connection factory.
spring.redis.url= # Connection URL, will override host, port and password (user will be ignored), e.g. redis://user:password@example.com:6379
spring.redis.host=localhost # Redis server host.
spring.redis.password= # Login password of the redis server.
spring.redis.ssl=false # Enable SSL support.
spring.redis.pool.max-active=8 # Max number of connections that can be allocated by the pool at a given time. Use a negative value for no limit.
spring.redis.pool.max-idle=8 # Max number of "idle" connections in the pool. Use a negative value to indicate an unlimited number of idle connections.
spring.redis.pool.max-wait=-1 # Maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) a connection allocation should block before throwing an exception when the pool is exhausted. Use a negative value to block indefinitely.
spring.redis.pool.min-idle=0 # Target for the minimum number of idle connections to maintain in the pool. This setting only has an effect if it is positive.
spring.redis.port=6379 # Redis server port.
spring.redis.sentinel.master= # Name of Redis server.
spring.redis.sentinel.nodes= # Comma-separated list of host:port pairs.
spring.redis.timeout=0 # Connection timeout in milliseconds.
```

At service layer, whenever the persistence layer is invoked, Spring can automatically cache any kind of operation (save, update, delete), thus keeping the caching layer always aligned with the database.

```java
@Service
@CacheConfig(cacheNames={"actors"})
public class ActorService {

    private final ActorRepository repository;

    public ActorService(ActorRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Cacheable(unless="#result == null")
    public Optional<Actor> findById(Long id) {
        return repository.findById(id);
    }

    @Cacheable(unless="#result == null")
    public List<Actor> findAll() {
        return repository.findAll();
    }

    @CachePut(key = "#result.id", unless = "#result == null")
    public Actor save(Actor actor) {
        return repository.save(actor);
    }

    @CacheEvict
    public void deleteById(Long id) {
        repository.deleteById(id);
    }

    @CacheEvict
    public void deleteAll() {
        repository.deleteAll();
    }
}
```

### @Cacheable
That's the Spring annotation to use when you want to cache whatever you are looking for in your persistence layer.

### @CachePut
That's the Spring annotation to use when you want to update whatever you are updating in your persistence layer.

### @CacheEvict
That's the Spring annotation to use when you want to delete whatever you are deleting from your persistence layer.

```

### Step 3
Check that the containers are up and running by exposing the appropriate ports; 6379 for Redis and 3306 for MySQL, as follows:
```shell
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                               NAMES
cd7b62e58a69   redislabs/redisgears:1.2.5   "docker-entrypoint.sâ¦"   17 minutes ago   Up 17 minutes   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp              redis
b344c5d25cf9   mysql:8.0.31                 "docker-entrypoint.sâ¦"   17 minutes ago   Up 17 minutes   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   mysql
```


## Pattern Write-Through
The patter Write-Through implies that the data inserted into the cache are also propagated to the database in a synchronous way. The client will have to wait the entire data flow to happen before receiving the reply from Redis. Might be seconds.

To do this, let's enter a key-value pair of type ```HASH``` data structure, by connecting to the redis container and using the ```redis-cli``` tool, as follows:
```shell
docker exec -it redis /bin/bash
root@cd7b62e58a69:/data# redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
(empty list or set)
127.0.0.1:6379> hset person:1 name Luigi lastname Fugaro age 44
Executing command...
(integer) 3
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "person:1"
127.0.0.1:6379> type person:1
"hash"
127.0.0.1:6379> hmget person:1 name lastname age
1) "Luigi"
2) "Fugaro"
3) "44"
127.0.0.1:6379>  
```

In the log of the ```redis``` service there should be the following entries:

```shell
redis        | 1:M 29 Jan 2023 15:18:03.656 * <module> JAVA_GEARS: PersonWriteThrough.Record: [{"key":"person:1","event":"hset","type":3,"stringVal":null,"hashVal":{"name":"Luigi","age":"44","lastname":"Fugaro"},"listVal":null,"setVal":null}]
redis        | Jan 29, 2023 3:18:05 PM org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.dialect.internal.DialectFactoryImpl logSelectedDialect
redis        | INFO: HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

Which means the ```PersonWriteThrough``` was triggered and its logic was executed by inserting the cache value as ```record``` into the table ```person``` in MySQL.

Let's check the database, by connecting to it and listing the records of the table person, as follows:

```shell
docker exec -it mysql mysql -u root -proot
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

+----+-------+----------+------+
|  1 | Luigi | Fugaro   |   44 |
+----+-------+----------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql>
```

All looks good!

## Pattern Write-Behind
The pattern Write-Behind implies that the data inserted into the cache are also propagated to the database in an _asynchronous_ way. The client will immediately receive the reply from Redis. Might be sub-millisecond.

Because you cannot have a Write-Through and a Write-Behind strategy at the same time for the same ```entity```, to do the test I set the keyPattern of the class ```com.foogaro.data.cache.PersonWriteBehind``` to "developer:*", so the new entry will bound to it.

To do this, let's enter a key-value pair of type ```HASH``` data structure, by connecting to the redis container and using the ```redis-cli``` tool, as follows:
```shell
docker exec -it redis /bin/bash
root@cd7b62e58a69:/data# redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
(empty list or set)
127.0.0.1:6379> hset developer:2 name Luigi lastname Fugaro age 44
(integer) 3
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "developer:2"
2) "person:1"
127.0.0.1:6379> type developer:2
"hash"
127.0.0.1:6379> hmget developer:2 name lastname age
1) "Luigi"
2) "Fugaro"
3) "44"
127.0.0.1:6379>  
```

In the log of the ```redis``` service there should be the following entries:

```shell
redis        | 1:M 29 Jan 2023 15:53:45.580 * <module> JAVA_GEARS: PersonWriteBehind.Record: [{"key":"developer:2","event":"hset","type":3,"stringVal":null,"hashVal":{"name":"Luigi","age":"44","lastname":"Fugaro"},"listVal":null,"setVal":null}]

redis        | INFO: HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

Which means the ```PersonWriteBehind``` was triggered and its logic was executed by inserting the cache value as ```record``` into the table ```person``` in MySQL.

Let's check the database, by connecting to it and listing the records of the table person, as follows:

```shell
docker exec -it mysql mysql -u root -proot

```

All looks good!

## Pattern Read-Through
The pattern Read-Through implies that when a data is requested from the cache, and it's not available, the data will be fetched directly from the database, synchronously, put it into the cache and returned to the client. The latter will have to wait the entire data flow to happen before receiving the reply from Redis. Might be seconds.

To do this, let's try to read the value for key "person:2", which shouldn't be found as we entered "developer:2".

Let's connect to the redis container and using the ```redis-cli``` tool, as follows:

```shell
docker exec -it redis /bin/bash
root@cd7b62e58a69:/data# redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "developer:2"
2) "person:1"
127.0.0.1:6379>  hmget person:2 name lastname age
1) "Luigi"
2) "Fugaro"
3) "44"
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "person:2"
2) "developer:2"
3) "person:1"
127.0.0.1:6379>
```
In the log of the ```redis``` service there should be the following entries:

```shell
redis        | 1:M 29 Jan 2023 16:31:36.601 * <module> JAVA_GEARS: PersonReadThrough.Record: [{"key":"person:2","event":"keymiss","type":-1,"stringVal":null,"hashVal":null,"listVal":null,"setVal":null}]
redis        | Jan 29, 2023 4:31:37 PM org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.dialect.internal.DialectFactoryImpl logSelectedDialect
redis        | INFO: HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

Which means the ```PersonReadThrough``` was triggered and its logic was executed by fetching the value from the table ```person``` in MySQL with ```ID``` "2".

All looks good!

## Pattern Refresh-Ahead
The purpose of the pattern Refresh-Ahead is to keep the data up-to-date. An example could be to refresh new/updated data for all those entries that were kept into the cache for too long, by using a time-to-live (TTL) on the key.

To do this, let's try to add a TTL of 5 seconds to the key "person:2", and wait for the expiration time, so that the key gets deleted from the cache.

Let's connect to the redis container and using the ```redis-cli``` tool, as follows:

```shell
docker exec -it redis /bin/bash
root@cd7b62e58a69:/data# redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "developer:2"
2) "person:1"
127.0.0.1:6379> expire person:2 5
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379>
```
In the log of the ```redis``` service there should be the following entries:

```shell
redis        | 1:M 29 Jan 2023 16:41:11.553 * <module> JAVA_GEARS: PersonRefreshAhead.Record: [{"key":"person:2","event":"expired","type":-1,"stringVal":null,"hashVal":null,"listVal":null,"setVal":null}]
redis        | Jan 29, 2023 4:41:12 PM org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.dialect.internal.DialectFactoryImpl logSelectedDialect
redis        | INFO: HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

Which means the ```PersonRefreshAhead``` was triggered and its logic was executed by fetching the value from the table ```person``` in MySQL with ```ID``` "2" and put it back into the cache.

The logic is almost the same as per the Read-Through patterns, except for the fact that the patterns gets triggered on the **expired** event and not on the _keymiss_ event.

## Pattern Read-Replica

The pattern Read-Replica comes from the Change Data Capture software design principals. Its goal is to detect changes from the source databases and push them to other systems, such as a caching layer, using message notification.

The solution is based on Debezium, a well known open-source project sponsored by Red Hat &reg;&copy;&trade;, which provides many connectors (aka Source Connectors), to detect changes happening in the source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, DB2, MongoDB, Cassandra, Vitess, Spanner).
In addition to the Source Connectors, Debezium provides even more Sink Connectors, whose goal is to push those changes to other systems.

![Change-Data-Capture](images/App-Cache-Db.png)


Debezium provides the Redis Sink Connector, which is used in this demo.

The following Docker configuration has been added to the ```docker-compose.yaml``` file:
```yaml
debezium:
  image: debezium/server
  container_name: debezium
  restart: "no"
  depends_on:
    - redis
  entrypoint: [ "echo", "Service debezium temporary disabled" ]
  env_file: ./.env
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=$MYSQLDB_DATABASE
  ports:
    - $DEBEZIUM_LOCAL_PORT:$DEBEZIUM_DOCKER_PORT
  volumes:
    - ./debezium-conf:/debezium/conf
    - ./debezium-data:/debezium/data
  networks:
  - demo
```

You may have noticed the presence of the entrypoint statement as a trick to _temporary_ disable Debezium when demoing the ```Write-*``` patterns.
To show the Read-Replica pattern in action, just comment the entrypoint statement, and everything should work as expected.
```yaml
debezium:
  image: debezium/server
  container_name: debezium
  restart: "no"
  depends_on:
    - redis
#  entrypoint: [ "echo", "Service debezium temporary disabled" ]
  env_file: ./.env
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=$MYSQLDB_DATABASE
  ports:
    - $DEBEZIUM_LOCAL_PORT:$DEBEZIUM_DOCKER_PORT
  volumes:
    - ./debezium-conf:/debezium/conf
    - ./debezium-data:/debezium/data
  networks:
  - demo
```

Let's start everything with ```docker-compose up```, and you should see now the Debezium service starting up, as follows:

In case you have problems, try to delete the ```mysql-data``` folder from your host, and try again.

Let's check on Redis what we have:
```shell
docker exec -it redis /bin/bash
root@7093c6289bbc:/data# redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "metadata:debezium:offsets"
2) "vdt"
3) "metadata:debezium:schema_history"
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

Debezium already has the logic to use Redis, both as internal storage and to push the changes to.

Let's add a new record for the table Person into MySQL, by connecting to the MySQL, as follows:

```shell
docker exec -it mysql mysql -u root -proot
mysql> use vdt;

Database changed
mysql> select * from person;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO person VALUES (1, 'Luigi','Fugaro',44);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> select * from person;
+----+-----------+----------+------+
| id | firstname | lastname | age  |
+----+-----------+----------+------+
|  1 | Luigi     | Fugaro   |   44 |
+----+-----------+----------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql>
```

Debezium should have detected the changes, that is the insert, and stored the metadata into Redis. Redis then should have picked those info up and processed them by inserting a new key into the cache.

Let's see...

In the log of the redis and debezium services, there should be the following entries:

```shell

```

All looks good.

Inside redis:

```shell
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "vdt.vdt.person"
2) "metadata:debezium:offsets"
3) "metadata:debezium:schema_history"
4) "vdt"
5) "person:1"
```
Two more keys were added.

Key ```person:1``` is the key which represent the corresponding record in MySQL, which is what we wanted:
```shell
127.0.0.1:6379> hmget person:1 id firstname lastname age
1) "1"
2) "Luigi"
3) "Fugaro"
4) "44"
```
MySQL's tables are mapped 1:1 to Redis streams, so key ```vdt.vdt.person``` is the key generated and used by Debezium to store event information for the person table, and that key is of type Redis Stream:

```shell
127.0.0.1:6379> type vdt.vdt.person
stream
127.0.0.1:6379> xread count 1 streams vdt.vdt.person 0
1) 1) "vdt.vdt.person"
   2) 1) 1) "1675271766422-0"
         2) 1) "{\"schema\":{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"type\":\"int32\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"id\"}],\"optional\":false,\"name\":\"vdt.vdt.person.Key\"},\"payload\":{\"id\":1}}"
            2) "{\"schema\":{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"type\":\"int32\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"id\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"firstname\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"lastname\"},{\"type\":\"int32\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"age\"}],\"optional\":true,\"name\":\"vdt.vdt.person.Value\",\"field\":\"before\"},{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"type\":\"int32\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"id\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"firstname\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"lastname\"},{\"type\":\"int32\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"age\"}],\"optional\":true,\"name\":\"vdt.vdt.person.Value\",\"field\":\"after\"},{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"version\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"connector\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"name\"},{\"type\":\"int64\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"ts_ms\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"name\":\"io.debezium.data.Enum\",\"version\":1,\"parameters\":{\"allowed\":\"true,last,false,incremental\"},\"default\":\"false\",\"field\":\"snapshot\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"db\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"sequence\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"table\"},{\"type\":\"int64\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"server_id\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"gtid\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"file\"},{\"type\":\"int64\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"pos\"},{\"type\":\"int32\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"row\"},{\"type\":\"int64\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"thread\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"query\"}],\"optional\":false,\"name\":\"io.debezium.connector.mysql.Source\",\"field\":\"source\"},{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"op\"},{\"type\":\"int64\",\"optional\":true,\"field\":\"ts_ms\"},{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"type\":\"string\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"id\"},{\"type\":\"int64\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"total_order\"},{\"type\":\"int64\",\"optional\":false,\"field\":\"data_collection_order\"}],\"optional\":true,\"name\":\"event.block\",\"version\":1,\"field\":\"transaction\"}],\"optional\":false,\"name\":\"vdt.vdt.person.Envelope\",\"version\":1},\"payload\":{\"before\":null,\"after\":{\"id\":1,\"firstname\":\"Luigi\",\"lastname\":\"Fugaro\",\"age\":44},\"source\":{\"version\":\"2.2.0.Alpha1\",\"connector\":\"mysql\",\"name\":\"vdt\",\"ts_ms\":1675271766000,\"snapshot\":\"false\",\"db\":\"vdt\",\"sequence\":null,\"table\":\"person\",\"server_id\":1,\"gtid\":\"9687809c-a253-11ed-b30d-0242ac200002:13\",\"file\":\"mysql-bin.000003\",\"pos\":2105,\"row\":0,\"thread\":17,\"query\":null},\"op\":\"c\",\"ts_ms\":1675271766219,\"transaction\":null}}"
```

And as we read the stream using the **XREAD** command above, what we get is: 
1. the name of the stream;
2. the timestamp of the generated event (Redis adds also a sequence number, that is used for entries created in the same millisecond. Since the sequence number is 64 bit wide, in practical terms there is no limit to the number of entries that can be generated within the same millisecond).
3. a JSON document referencing the metadata about the impacted primary key on the database side;
4. a JSON document referencing the changes of state, with a before and after state snapshots at columns grained level. 

By processing the event and its payload you can clearly understand which key you need to manage in Redis, if it's a new key (insert), old key (update), or a delete operation, in that case payload-before would be not null and payload-after would be null.

## Where is Kafka?

If you didn't notice, there is no Kafka cluster running, that's because the architecture used Debezium Server, and the reliability of the event store is implemented directly in Redis as persistent data store.

The fact that Redis is also the caching layer, easy the logic to update application's caches.

That's all Folks.
